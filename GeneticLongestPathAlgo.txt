1. Chromosome Representation:
   Define a representation of potential solutions (chromosomes). In the context of finding the longest path, a chromosome could represent a sequence of nodes.

2. Initial Population:
   Create an initial population of chromosomes. These could be random or generated using some heuristic.

3. Fitness Function:
   Define a fitness function that evaluates the quality of each chromosome. The fitness should reflect how close a given path is to being the longest path.

4. Selection:
   Implement a selection process to choose chromosomes for reproduction based on their fitness. Common methods include roulette wheel selection or tournament selection.

5. Crossover:
   Implement crossover (recombination) to create new chromosomes from the selected ones. This step mimics genetic recombination.

6. Mutation:
   Apply mutation to some of the new chromosomes. Mutation introduces small changes in the chromosomes.

7. Replacement:
   Replace the old population with the new population.

8. Termination:
   Determine a termination condition, such as a maximum number of generations or reaching a satisfactory solution.

9. Result Extraction:
   Extract the best chromosome from the final population as the solution.
